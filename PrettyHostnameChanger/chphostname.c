 * chphostname.c
 * 
 * Pretty Hostname Changer - Changes Pretty Hostname of System
 *  Directly modifies /etc/machine-info file (if there is not, creates it)
 *  Same job can easily done by adding PRETTY_HOSTNAME=[NAME] line into
 *  file.
 * 
 * Static Hostname can be change by "hostnamectl set-hostname [NAME]"
 *  command via terminal (at least for Fedora 18)
